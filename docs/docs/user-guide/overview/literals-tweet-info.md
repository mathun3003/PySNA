- ```id```: The integer representation of the unique identifier for this Tweet.  
- ```id_str```: The string representation of the unique identifier for this Tweet.  
- ```full_text```: The actual UTF-8 full text of the status update.  If the tweet is a retweet (marked by a leading 'RT' within the text), the text will be truncated to 140 characters. The full text of the original tweet is contained within the
- ```display_text_range```: The range of the tweet text characters provided as array containing the indexes of first and last character.  
```retweeted_status``` field. Hence, add the ```retweeted_status``` fields to the ```attributes``` list and see under ```retweeted_status``` -> ```full_text``` fields for the full text of the retweet.
- ```truncated```: Indicates whether the value of the ```text``` parameter was truncated, for example, as a result of a retweet exceeding the original Tweet text length limit of 140 characters. Truncated text will end in ellipsis, like this ... Since Twitter now rejects long Tweets vs truncating them, the large majority of Tweets will have this set to ```false``` . Note that while native retweets may have their toplevel text property shortened, the original text will be available under the ```retweeted_status``` object and the ```truncated``` parameter will be set to the value of the original status (in most cases, ```false```).  
- ```created_at```: UTC time when this Tweet was created.  
- ```entities```: Entities which have been parsed out of the text of the Tweet (hashtags, URLs, user mentions, media, symbols, polls).  
- ```tweet_annotations```: Context annotations and named entities of the Tweet object. Context annotations are derived from the analysis of a Tweet’s text and will include a domain and entity pairing which can be used to discover Tweets on topics that may have been previously difficult to surface. Named Entities are comprised of people, places, products, and organizations. Entities are delivered as part of the entity payload section. They are programmatically assigned based on what is explicitly mentioned (named-entity recognition) in the Tweet text. See the [official website](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations/overview) for further details.

- ```possibly_sensitive```: This field indicates content may be recognized as sensitive. The Tweet author can select within their own account preferences and choose “Mark media you tweet as having material that may be sensitive” so each Tweet created after has this flag set.

- ```sentiment```: The sentiment of the Tweet, either positive, neutral, or negative. Polarity scores are returned additionally. The sentiment is detected by using [VADER](https://vadersentiment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is recommended to analyze only english Tweets.
